title: A couple of things I've done.

<p id="werk">First things first: here's my <a href="schultz_sans_address.pdf">resume</a>.
<br>
<br>
For BKLYNER, I wrote about the lack of<a href="https://bklyner.com/why-is-it-so-hard-to-compost-and-what-happened-to-the-brown-bin-program/" target="_blank">composting in Bedford-Stuyvesant</a>. 
<br>
<br>
In undergrad, I wrote about <a href="http://www.ricethresher.org/article/2017/01/berlin-wall-segment-other-structures-vandalized-overnight-with-pro-trump-messages-v2" target="_blank">pro-Trump vandalism on the Berlin Wall</a>. It won a statewide campus newspaper prize for breaking news. 
<br>
<br>
Up next: before I graduate, I'll finish computational projects about 2020 election campaign finance data and ad revenue on fake news sites. I'm also putting the finishing touches on my master's project, which mapped every monument in New York City.</p>
