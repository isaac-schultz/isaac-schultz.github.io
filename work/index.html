<p id="werk">First things first: here's my <a href="schultz_sans_address.pdf" target="blank">resume</a>.
  <br>
   <br>
For BKLYNER, I wrote about the lack of <a href="https://bklyner.com/why-is-it-so-hard-to-compost-and-what-happened-to-the-brown-bin-program/" target="_blank">composting in Bedford-Stuyvesant</a>.
  <br>
  <br>
For the Brown Institute for Media Innovation, I wrote about <a href="https://brown.columbia.edu/open-source-investigation/" target="_blank"> geolocating a dog</a> with tools from Bellingcat, an open-source digital investigation outfit.
  <br>
  <br>
For The Rice Thresher, I wrote about <a href="http://www.ricethresher.org/article/2017/01/berlin-wall-segment-other-structures-vandalized-overnight-with-pro-trump-messages-v2" target="_blank">pro-Trump vandalism on the Berlin Wall</a>. It won a statewide campus newspaper prize for breaking news. 
  <br>
  <br>
Before I graduate, I'll finish computational projects about 2020 election campaign finance data and ad revenue on fake news sites.
  <br>
  <br>
I'm also putting the finishing touches on my master's project, which mapped every monument in New York City. It will be published soon, and I'll post about it on <a href="https://twitter.com/isaac_schultz_" target="_blank">Twitter</a> - did I mention you should follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/isaac_schultz_" target="_blank">Twitter</a>?</p>
