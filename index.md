**Hello!**

This site is just getting started, so you'll have to give me a couple days and a few headlines before things start looking a bit more reputable.

In the meantime, please feel free to reach out to me or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/isaac_schultz_). Seriously, my content isn't half bad. Puns, maps, science stuff. And if you didn't see it before, [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/isaac_schultz_).
